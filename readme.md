**Dragon**
==========

A simple, turn-based game, heavily inspired by [Tiny Dice Dungeon](http://appstore.com/tinydicedungeon).

Built entirely from scratch in `HTML5`, `CSS3`, and most importantly `JavaScript`.

Graphics are non-existent currently; you'll just have to use you're imagination.

Future updates may include:

	* Canvas for sprite animations
	  
	* Level progression with multiple enemies/increasing strengths
	  
	* RPG-style upgrades for the knight 

*Built for Chrome, beautiful in Safari, passable in Firefox, IE... ?*
